# About these Texts

The Lustre file system is an open parallel file system used in high performance computing.
Lustre can be installed from readily available `.rpm` files for specific distributions or alternatively built from source.

In order to test and experiment (or develop), it is advisable to set up a test system.
The current developers of lustre (Whamcloud, written October 2024) provide a set of instructions for the compilation of the lustre software on older releases, however more recent distros are lacking.
(Though the `.rpm` files are available for other distributions.)

The foundations for the instructions presented herin is a tutorial for building a test-lustre on Rocky 8.7 as provided by Whamcloud, available here: https://wiki.whamcloud.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=258179277

This tutorial has been adapted to build lustre on other releases, resolving missing dependencies as well as the odd quirk.

The work was carried out at the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin at the Computer- und Medienservice.

**Please note that in this adapted configuration, shortcuts have been taken and there is no guarantee of all features working.**
**It builds and it installs, it seems to work, that is it.**
**The result obtained from these tutorials is intended as a local sandbox only.**
